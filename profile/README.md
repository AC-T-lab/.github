# Welcome to AC&T Lab 👋

## About our lab
Our lab uses computational or experimental tools to study thermal-fluid problems, specifically in regards to chemical kinetics of fuels, aerosol filtration, cooling and complex fluids. 

Established at NSYSU in Summer 2012, AC&T lab has been funded largely by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan. The group members comprise 4-6 MS students from mechanical engineering. The lab conducts numerous computational projects granted from MOST and industry in Taiwan. Each of our MS students typically spends two years to complete the coursework and thesis. In addition to offering thermal-fluid solutions, the lab aims at training students to be more competent with their English skills.
